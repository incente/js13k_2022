DEAD AGAIN
=====

by sanojian and repsej


Death was not enough to keep these evil spirits down.  

Defend yourself against the onslaught of zombies, vampires, ghosts ... and more.   

The longer you play, the stronger they get.  

Survive for as long as you can, but it is only a matter of time before you are …… DEAD AGAIN
