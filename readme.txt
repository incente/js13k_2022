DEAD AGAIN
by sanojian and repsej

Death was not enough to keep these evil spirits from rising again.  

Defend yourself against the onslaught of zombies, vampires, ghosts ... and more.   

The longer you play, the stronger they get.  

Survive for as long as you can, but it is only a matter of time before you are …… DEAD AGAIN
