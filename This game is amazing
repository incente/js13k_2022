Hey, this is my first day using GitHub so i dont know if its the right way to commentate. But i want to say ur game really impressed me. 
And more important, it inspires me to try my best in creating a own one. I have to write a thesis about gamedesign for my school.
And the game type i submitted is topdown shooter. So i hope my game is just a little bit like yours. Only difference is that i have to write it in C#
because i design it in Untiy. Whitch is probably way easier. 
It was really fun to play your game, im a big fan. 
How long did it take to code the whole thing?
